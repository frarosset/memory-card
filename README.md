# memory-card

A project from The Odin Project (Full Stack Javascript).

A memory card game is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

At each turn, you have to select a card without picking the same card twice.

There are four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard, and incremental (which starts with 3 cards and where the number of cards and difficulty increase at each turn).

Card images are provided by the [AI Cats API](https://ai-cats.net/).
